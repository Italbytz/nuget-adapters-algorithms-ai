# Introduction

This package ([Source Code](https://github.com/Italbytz/nuget-adapters-algorithms-ai))
provides implementations for the algorithms discussed
in [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu).
Most of the code is based on code from the
official [AIMA repositories](https://github.com/aimacode). It follows
the [Hexagonal Architecture](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/)
in implementing the ports defined
in [Italbytz.Ports.Algorithms](https://github.com/Italbytz/nuget-ports-algorithms-ai).
